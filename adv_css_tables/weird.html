            <h2>Welcome To Weird Gators & Crocs</h2>
            <h3>We Got Some Weird Ones!</h3>
            <p>Some Crocodiles and Alligators are quite weird and they adapt to their environments.
            Some of the weirdest Crocodiles are the Gharial is one one the largest fish nomming crocodiles with a very slender snout.
            The Slender Snouted Crocodile is another with a very weird head shape with the slender snout.
            It is cool to see how they adapt to the different food they eat and the environments.</p>

            <p>There are also a few strange Alligators as well.
            One example is the Chinese Alligator which has a stubby snoot.
            Another is the Albino American Alligator which is completely white, while not a special species, it's just Albino
            There are not many Alligators, but these are some of the strange Alligators.</p>
