        <h2>The Weirdest Dinosaurs</h2>
        <h3>Oh Yes, Derpy Inbound</h3>
        <p>Some dinosaurs were very weird like the Amargasaurus. It was a long neck plant eating dinosaur that had spines all along its neck.
            Another weird dinosaur was the Pachycephalosaurus, it had a dome of bone on its head that was 9 inches thick
            Another was the Spinosaurus, it was a large carnivore what had a spine along its back and walked on 4 legs and swam in the water. As you can see, dinosaurs came in many different varieties for many different enviorments. </p>

        <h4>Spinosaurus Facts</h4>
        <p>The Spinosauru sis one of my favorite dinosaurs. It was very unique compared to other dinosaurs. it was a semi aquatic one with a large sail on its back. It mainly scavenged and ate fish.
            It is the largest carivorus dinosaur known currently. It walked on 4 legs and its back legs were rather short. It is indeed a strange dinosaur.</p>
