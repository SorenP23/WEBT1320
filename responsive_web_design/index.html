            <h3>Take A Look At This!</h3>
            <p>Crocodiles and Alligators are cool, they are like long lizards that can be a bit spicy when provoked.
            They are as old as time itself, like Doctor Whoâ€¦ except I don't think they can time travel through space.
            They live in the water and hunt fish and whatever gets in the water they are in.
            Crocodiles and alligators are not the same, they have some differences. Such as Alligators have a U-shaped snout and Crocodiles have a V-shaped snout.</p>

            <p>There were also some massive crocodiles in prehistoric times. There was a Sarcosuchus which was 30 ft long.
            There was also the Deinosuchus which was nearly 40 ft long and weighed 17,000lbs.
            There was also the Purussaurus which was the largest ever at 42 ft and weighed 18,000lbs
            These were ambush predators capable of taking down some dinosaurs.</p>
